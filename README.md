# OS
Operating Systems course at FMI, 2023

The OS course revolves around solving numerous Bash and C problems and
here I am going to upload them and some of my solutions. The problems
are written in the os-problems.pdf file. Every C problem from the pdf file
has its own folder with the same name including the solution as 'main.c'.
The Makefile required for compiling those solutions for the C problems
for Linux based machines is located in the Makefile folder.
